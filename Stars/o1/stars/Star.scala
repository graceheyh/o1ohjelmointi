/** Each `Star` object represents a star on a star map. It records some basic information
  * (an identifier, a location, and a magnitude); in addition, some but not all stars have
  * been assigned a name. (In reality, many stars have multiple alternative names, but this
  * class does not capture that fact.)
  *
  * @param id         a number that uniquely identifies the star from the other visible stars (a so-called Henry Draper number)
  * @param coords     the location of the star on a two-dimensional star map
  * @param magnitude  the apparent magnitude (brightness) of the star: *smaller means brighter!*
  * @param name       the starâ€™s name (wrapped in `Some`), or `None` */
